Automatically generated stress tests determine the critical parameters for each service component and measure performance bottlenecks.  As the configuration module gathers these data, it creates a model of the service, and it uses this model to manage autonomously the resources used by the service; it scales resource allocations up or down automatically to meet service demand.

The tremendous power of a quantum computers comes from its ability to compute on all these states at once, but it reduces to a classical computer if this superposition is perturbed by any external electromagnetic disturbance. The Bell Labs topological qubits are intrinsically immune to such disturbances by design and their state can only be changed by specific choreographed 'braiding' motion of charge, making them uniquely suited to build large many-qubit quantum computers.

Automated application-driven orchestration of solutions spanning all of these entities, and supporting as-a-Service business models (including decentralized blockchain-enabled business models), will be both critical for accelerating digital innovation and challenging to achieve.  AI/ML and distributed ledger technology are two keys to realize this level of orchestration automation and ecosystem co-creation."

Future networks will leverage AI natively and comprehensively, including replacing traditional algorithmic function implementations and powering predictive orchestration automation at many levels.\nTo realize this, networks will adopt a ‘Cognitive Data Fusion Plane’ (in addition to the well-established user, control and management planes) designed to drive advanced AI-native solutions, as well as facilitating the data needs of more conventional algorithmic optimizations.  This new plane will introduce flexible AI-optimized data ingestion, transformation, multi-stakeholder data fusion, and secure exposure as a systemic capability throughout the network.  This will significantly elevate the impact of AI and extend its application to real-time control loops.\n"

But for complex higher-order optimizations to be realized, a comprehensive and wholistic model of the network is needed, one which allows insights-visualization to anticipate needs and actions, and then sandboxing, assessment and trialing of potential high-impact optimizations to assess outcomes prior to operationalization.  Such a network digital twin will symbiotically leverage and complement data and localized insights from the Cognitive Data Fusion Plane and heighten the effectiveness and efficiency gains of orchestration.  Cross-twin interactions could extend these gains to multi-stakeholder solutions, as well as incorporate more specialized in-depth twins such as for radio environment simulation."
